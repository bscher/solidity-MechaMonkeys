# About
A custom ERC721 contract for Ethereum that is a "free-mint" of an NFT collection with 10k tokens pointing to 10k immutable IPFS hashes.

Although the images and metadata are immutable, the release still included multiple stages. This was accomplished by pre-defining the IPFS hashes for each release, but not host the files of later stages until it was time for the contract to progress to that stage. This is similar to publicly displaying Torrent hashes without seeding any of the data until intended to.

- `Solidity` for the Ethereum contract
- `npm` for packaging and testing
- `truffle` for testing and flattening for deployments
